Summary:

Jupyter notebook.
Code in Python using rainfall data to predict the level of flooding for 

Southern Malawi experienced major flooding in 2015 (13 January) and 2019 (14 March).

This area has been divided into XXXX 1 kilometer squares, each with a unique identifier.
For each square thre is the following data:
* Rainfall data for the 18 weeks, beginning 2 months prior to the 2015 flood.
* Mean elevation 
* Dominant Land Cover

The target variable is the proportion of flooding (0 to 1) for each square. 

The predictive model will be assessed using the data from the 2019 data and the 
evaluation metric will be Root Mean Squared Error.
